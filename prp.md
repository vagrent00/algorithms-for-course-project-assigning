## Online/Offline requirement

### strategy

+ divide each project into two parts

  + after seperate assignment, preference may not coincide, i.e. some projects are selected by offline students but no online student like it, or vice versa.

+ It must be determined that which projects to choose. To enforce fairness, it's suggested that the target projects are first (loosely) chosen by the normal procedure for 7(?) rounds.

  + In the example provided, after 7 turns of assignment, 7 students and 3 projects are left. 

  + It's generally reasonable to only consider these projects.

+ Since the 8th(there will first be major requirement enforcement) turn, examine all projects that have 4 or 5 students.  Projects that doesn't meet the requirement of 1 or 2 offline student are illegal projects.

  + Increase the cost of (random) (global) online students in illegal projects by 5(?) each time. It may also be necessary to increase the cost of offline students in projects that are fiiled by 5 offline students.
  + Remove all the assignments, redo the assignment.
  + Repeat untill the requirement is satisfied. (Ideally)



## Major Requirement

### strategy

+ This should happen before enforcing the online/offline requirement. Some seats for some projects (the major required ones) will not be pop off during further assignments.
+ (This only happen once) After loosely determining project candidates (turn 7), the major requirements of some projects will be satisfied first. i.e. let ECE slots and ME slots choose first. 
+ After certain rounds, if the project still doesn't have enough people, the project will be discarded and the students are free. After deleting, redo the assignment totally.
